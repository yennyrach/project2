# Question Title Removal Refactoring Documentation

## Overview
This refactoring removes all references to `question.title` from the codebase and updates search functionality to focus on three specific fields: `subject`, `disease/condition`, and `topic`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Search Functionality Updates
**File:** `src/components/Questions/QuestionList.tsx`
- **Before:** Search included `clinicalVignette`, `leadQuestion`, and `topic`
- **After:** Search now focuses exclusively on `subject`, `disease`, and `topic`
- **Rationale:** Streamlines search to most relevant identifying fields

### 2. Display Component Updates
**Files:** 
- `src/components/Questions/QuestionCard.tsx`
- `src/components/Review/ReviewQuestions.tsx`
- `src/components/Exams/ExamBooks.tsx`
- `src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Replaced all `question.title` references with `{question.subject} - {question.topic}` format
- Removed conditional logic that checked for title existence
- Simplified component rendering by eliminating title-related fallbacks

### 3. Removed Conditional Logic
**Impact:** Eliminated all conditional statements that:
- Checked for `question.title` existence
- Used title as fallback when other fields were unavailable
- Handled title-related state management

### 4. Updated Search Placeholder
**Change:** Search input placeholder updated to "Search by subject, disease/condition, or topic..." to reflect new search scope

## Testing Coverage

### Test Files Created:
1. `src/__tests__/QuestionSearch.test.tsx` - Comprehensive search functionality tests
2. `src/__tests__/QuestionDisplay.test.tsx` - Display component tests
3. `src/__tests__/FilteringLogic.test.tsx` - Filtering logic unit tests

### Test Coverage Includes:
- Search by each of the three specified fields (subject, disease, topic)
- Case-insensitive search functionality
- Empty search handling
- No results scenarios
- Combined filter and search operations
- Display of subject-topic format instead of titles
- Null/undefined field value handling
- UI component rendering without title references

## Breaking Changes

### User-Facing Changes:
1. **Question Headers:** Now display as "Subject - Topic" instead of question titles
2. **Search Scope:** Search no longer includes clinical vignette or lead question text
3. **Display Format:** Consistent subject-topic format across all components

### API/Data Changes:
- **None:** No changes to underlying data structure
- **Backward Compatibility:** Maintained for all data operations

## Migration Steps

### For Developers:
1. Update any custom components that reference `question.title`
2. Adjust search expectations to focus on subject/disease/topic fields
3. Update any documentation that references title-based functionality

### For Users:
1. **Search Behavior:** Users should now search using subject names, disease/condition terms, or topic keywords
2. **Display Changes:** Question lists now show "Subject - Topic" format in headers

## Performance Improvements

1. **Reduced String Operations:** Eliminated multiple conditional string checks for title
2. **Simplified Filtering:** Streamlined search logic with fewer field checks
3. **Cleaner Rendering:** Removed conditional rendering logic for title display

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items:
- Display format changes (cosmetic)
- Search field reduction (focused improvement)
- Conditional logic removal (simplification)

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures functionality preservation
- Gradual rollout recommended for user-facing changes
- Documentation updated to reflect new search behavior

## Future Considerations

1. **Search Enhancement:** Consider adding advanced search options if users need broader search capabilities
2. **Display Customization:** May add user preferences for question display format
3. **Analytics:** Monitor search usage patterns to validate field selection effectiveness
